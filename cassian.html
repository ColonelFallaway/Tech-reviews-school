            <h3>SteelSeries  Apex Pro Mini</h3>
            <p>The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini keyboard is one of the best keyboards out in the market, that takes your gaming experience to a whole new level. The company SteelSeries is one of the biggest tech companies worldwide that create the best quality accessories for gaming and is well known in the gaming industry. The keyboard SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini was released back in June 2022 and ever since, it's used by many professional players, including myself because I have always liked pc games and had always bought SteelSeries stuff and since this keyboard was released, well I fell in love with it and i will explain why but until then i will talk a little bit about the history of the keyboard.</p>
            <h3>The history</h3>
            <p>SteelSeries first launched the Apex Pro line in 2019, introducing the world's innovative OmniPoint switches. These switches were unique because they allowed users to adjust the actuation point (the point at which a keypress register) between 0.4mm and 3.6mm. This was a breakthrough for gamers, especially competitive players, who needed customizable actuation for faster or more controlled keypresses. 
            </p>
            <p>The original Apex Pro keyboards, which featured a full-sized layout and a TKL (Tenkeyless) version, became known for their versatility, excellent build quality, and advanced technology. This established SteelSeries as a leader in customizable gaming keyboards.</p>
            <h3>The rise of mini keyboards</h3>
            <p>As gaming and esports communities evolved, so did the demand for more compact keyboards. The rise of 60% and 65% layout became a trend in the gaming world due to their smaller footprint, giving more players more room for mouse movement and they are especially useful in FPS and fast-paced games such as (fortnite,valorant,cs:go, etcâ€¦). These layouts focus on essential keys and omit functions like the number pad, function row, and dedicated arrow keys, which can be accessed via layers instead. In response to this trend, SteelSeries recognized the need for a smaller, high-performance keyboard with all the customizability of the larger Apex Pro but in a compact form factor. This led to the creation of Apex Pro Mini.</p>
            <h3>June 2022</h3>
            <p>As a demand for compact keyboards grew, especially among competitive gamers, SteelSeries responded by launching the Apex Pro mini. The SteelSeries Apex Pro mini keyboard is a premium, 60% mechanical keyboard built with an aircraft-grade aluminum alloy frame, giving it a sleek, durable design that feels solid despite its compact size. The standout feature is the OmniPoint 2.0 adjustable switches, allowing you to customize the actuation point of each key from 0.2mm-3.8mm - perfect for ultra fast gaming or comfortable typing. This keyboard also includes dual-action capability, letting users assign two functions to a single key based on how deep the key is pressed, in conclusion this keyboard has a 0,2ms response time in delay.</p>
            <p>The keyboard also features RGB per key- lightning, customizable through SteelSeries Engine Software, with up to five onboard profiles. This keyboard also has an wireless version which adds Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, along with up to 30 hours of battery life. </p>
            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>Overall this keyboard is one of the best gaming keyboards for competitive games and writing and i highly recommend it because it's a very comfortable and fast responding keyboard and if you are a gamer like me i recommend buying the 60% version and not the TKL one because even though it has tenkeyless its still big (my personal opinion).</p>
            <h3>MSRP</h3>
            <p>The keyboard is priced at 179.99 dollars = 1870,55 swedish crowns (kroner) but there is also the wireless version which is 239.99 dollars= 2494,10 swedish crowns (kroner) which is 60 dollars more and personally i'm not recommending the wireless version because it cost much more and it doesn't help with the gaming experience, plus you have to charge it every 30h so its not worth it in my opinion but for the people that want the wireless one and have money but don't know what to do with them, they can go right ahead and buy it.</p>
