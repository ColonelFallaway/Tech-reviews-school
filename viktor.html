            <h3>Logitech G PRO X headset</h3>
            
            <p>The newly released (2024) G pro x SE logitech headset is an excellent option for all of your sound related gaming needs, with its excellent sound quality and its perfect materials.

The headphones itself has a tiny issue though, because of its many technical properties it's quite heavy and may leave a dent in your new haircut or if long term without taking them off they may even create a dent on your head. The voice quality while talking to friends, business associates or even random people online is truly exceptional through featuring its detachable microphone with Blue VO!CE technology for clear voice capture. The headset is compatible with a wide variety of gaming platforms such as PC, Playstation and Xbox.</p>

            <p>The price of the headset is 899 kr according to The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). The design of the headset is  a simple cool silvery gray around the metal parts and a nice and dark black as the all rounder. With two big circular ear cups made of memory foam these ear cups fully envelop the ears of the wearer which is usually called over-ear headphones and much like earmuffs they provide comfort, noise isolation, and enhanced sound quality.</p>

            <p>The headband of the headgear features a steel-reinforced frame for strength and durability. It is wrapped in soft memory foam padding covered with leatherette for comfort during extended use. While the ear cups are made of plastic for added durability and the padding inside of the ear pads are made of memory foam which is covered by either included materials that is leatherette or cloth which you can choose from either comfort or breathability. These head pads cover the drivers which deliver the sound straight from your computer. The PRO G 50mm audio drivers which are unique to the G PRO series are designed to deliver clear and precise sound across a wide frequency range.
